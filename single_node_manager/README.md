Here's a refined explanation to help a new user on the "Young" cluster utilize your script:

## Running Many Jobs Concurrently on a Single Node

This script is designed to run many independent calculations on a single "Young" cluster node, making the most of all its available processor cores. Instead of submitting hundreds of separate jobs, this approach efficiently handles them all within one allocation.

On Young, nodes typically have **40 cores**. This script intelligently detects that number and ensures that up to 40 of your calculations run at the same time. As soon as one calculation finishes, the script automatically starts the next one until all your tasks are complete. Each calculation (e.g., `par_1`, `par_2`, etc.) is assigned to its own core.

The output from each calculation is handled by your `./CoS` program, just as it would be if you ran them individually.

### How to Use This Script

1.  **Save the Script:** Copy and paste the entire script into a new file. A good name for it would be `job.sh`.

2.  **Customize for Your Needs:**
    * Open `job.sh` using a text editor (like `nano` or `vi`).
    * Locate the line:
        ```bash
        MAX_PARAM_FILE_INDEX=450 # <--- IMPORTANT: SET THIS TO YOUR HIGHEST par_ FILE INDEX
        ```
    * **Change `450`** to the actual highest number of your `par_` files. For example, if you have `par_1` through `par_300`, change it to `300`.

3.  **Make it Executable:** Before you can submit the script, you need to give it permission to run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x job.sh
    ```

4.  **Submit the Job:** Use the `sbatch` command to submit your script to the Slurm scheduler on Young:
    ```bash
    qsub job.sh
    ```

### Understanding the Output

* **`output.%j.%N.log`**: This file (or `output.<jobid>.<nodename>.log`) will contain the standard output messages from your script and any `echo` statements within it. It will show you which `par_` files are being launched.
* **`error.%j.%N.log`**: This file will capture any error messages from your script or the `CoS` executables.

By using this script, you can efficiently process all your calculations on a single node, maximizing core utilization without needing to rewrite your `CoS` code or use complex parallel libraries.
