Single-Point energy calculation
====================================


In this section, a single-point (**SP**) energy calculation at the B3LYP level of theory is included. The &Print section request the printing of the first
5 lower LUMOs and 5 upper HOMOs. This is not a **TDDFT** calculation, but usually XC provides a reasonable HOMO-LUMO gap value.
